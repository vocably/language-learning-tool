  <p>When I started Vocably, I ensured users could learn multiple languages.</p>

  <p>I won't lie; the multi-lang functionality is a bit clumsy here.</p>

  <p>
    While the multi-lang functionality is not as smooth as I envision,<br />I
    want to assure you that I'm actively improving it.
  </p>

  <p>For now, let's focus on the language you'd like to learn the most.</p>

  <p>
    I will make multi-lang learning as soomth as possible in the future. I
    promise.
