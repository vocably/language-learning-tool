    <h1 class="mb-5 text-center">Okay, I installed Vocably. Now what?</h1>

    <p class="p-4 rounded-4 bg-light small rounded">Would you like to try Vocably extension for <i class="bi bi-apple"></i> iOS mobile Safari browser?<br /><a href="/ios-safari-extension.html">Here is the instruction.</a></p>

    <p>So you have installed Vocably for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vocably-pro-language-cards/id1641258757" target="_blank">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vocablypro" target="_blank">Android</a> and have no idea what to do next?</p>

    <p>Let me help you.</p>

    <p>You can see Vocably as a combination of <b>Google Translate</b> and <b>Quizlet</b> (or Memrise, or Anki).</p>

    <p>With Vocably you can:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Translate words and phrases</li>
      <li>Learn the translated words and phrases</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For the learning, Vocably uses a spaced repetition method.</p>

    <p>If you haven’t heard of “spaced repetition” (aka SRS, aka flashcards), &mdash; it is one of the best learning methods available to people.</p>

    <h2>How can I start?</h2>

    <p>When you open the app for the first time, you will see a “welcome screen of nothing”.</p>

    <p>
      <img src="assets/welcome/screen-of-nothing.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Welcome screen of nothing.">
    </p>

    <p>To make it more useful, click the “Look up” tab.</p>

    <p>
      <img src="assets/welcome/look-up-tab.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Look up tab.">
    </p>

    <p>In the Look up tab, select a language you study and the language you speak fluently.</p>

    <p>
      <img src="assets/welcome/language-selected.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Select languages.">
    </p>

    <p>As an example, we use English as the language to learn, and Russian, as the language we can speak fluently.</p>

    <p>Now you can solve two problems with Vocably:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Problem #1: I see a new word and want to translate it.</li>
      <li>Problem #2: I want to say something, but I don’t know the word for it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problem #1: I see a new word and want to translate it</h3>

    <p>
      <img src="assets/welcome/translate-new-word.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Translate new word.">
    </p>

    <p>Type a word you want to know in the text input and click the <i class="bi bi-search"></i> icon.</p>

    <p>Click the <i class="bi bi-plus-circle-fill"></i> icon to add this word to your collection.</p>

    <h3 id="reverse-translation">Problem #2: I want to say something, but I don’t know the word for it</h3>

    <p>
      <img src="assets/welcome/reverse-translation.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Reverse translation.">
    </p>

    <p>
      Click the “reverse translation” button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Type a word or phrase in your native language and click the <i class="bi bi-search"></i> icon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <i class="bi bi-plus-circle-fill"></i> icon for the word you want to add to your collection.
    </p>


    <h2>Learning your words</h2>

    <p>After you have added a couple of words to your collection, you can click on the “Cards” tab and start learning your words.</p>

    <p>
      <img src="assets/welcome/cards-tab.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="Cards tab with words.">
    </p>

    <p>Click the “Practice” button and you will enter the practice mode.</p>

    <p>Swipe right if you can remember the word.</p>

    <p>
      <video loop autoplay muted controls class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 400px;">
        <source src="assets/welcome/swipe-right.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </p>

    <p>Words that you swiped right will show up less often in the next learning sessions.</p>

    <p>If you can't remember the word, you can tap on it to see it's translation.</p>

    <p>Swipe left the words that you can't remember.</p>

    <p>
      <video loop autoplay muted controls class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 400px;">
        <source src="assets/welcome/swipe-left.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </p>

    <p>Words that you can’t yet remember will show up more often in the next learning sessions.</p>
