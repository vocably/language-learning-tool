    <p>
      Hi, I'm Dima Snisarenko, an <a href="https://sneas.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">independent developer</a> from Ukraine, living in the Netherlands since 2014.
    </p>

    <p>I created Vocably because I wanted to read news in Dutch and learn the words I translated.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Vocably, now, I can read and understand most news articles. Not all of them, but I'm a confident reader.</p>

    <p>
      Now, Iâ€™m working on my listening. I watch YouTube videos and listen to podcasts in Dutch and use Vocably to translate and learn new words.
