    <h1 class="h3">Made for Active Language&nbsp;Users</h1>
    <p>Vocably is designed for people who regularly need to look up new words and phrases in a translation dictionary.</p>

    <p>That’s usually:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Students learning a foreign language with a teacher.</li>
      <li>People who use a foreign language in their daily lives.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If that sounds like you, Vocably can make a real difference. It helps you translate words and phrases and learn them as you go — so you're not just translating, you're building up your vocabulary.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you don’t regularly need to translate or learn new words, Vocably might not be for you. But whenever that need arises — Vocably’s here to help.

    <h2 class="h4">Vocably browser extension and mobile app will help you to:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Quickly translate any unfamiliar word or phrase</li>
      <li>Save that word or phrase as a flashcard</li>
      <li>Remember the saved flashcard</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Flashcards created with Vocably include the translation, part of speech, transcription, gender, definition, and an example of use.

    <p>Translate with Vocably in the following situations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You see an unfamiliar word in the browser or on your mobile screen</li>
      <li>You hear a word or see it on the street</li>
      <li>You want to say something in a foreign language but don’t know the right word</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h4">Language learning is mostly about memorizing words and phrases</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
      To practice saved flashcards, Vocably uses the spaced repetition method (also known as Spaced Repetition System, or SRS). This technique, developed over a century ago, is designed to help you memorize large volumes of information. It forms the basis of popular programs like Anki, Quizlet, and Memrise.
