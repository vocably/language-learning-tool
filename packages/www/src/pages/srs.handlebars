    <p>
      Vocably is designed to handle extensive collections of cards — hundreds or even thousands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once your collection hits a certain size (say, 30 or 100 cards), reviewing all of them in a single practice session is not practical.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thankfully, you don’t have to. With the help of a smart sorting algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>, created in 1985 based on research on long-term memory, Vocably shows you only the cards that need reviewing — like new cards or ones you haven’t practiced in a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every time you swipe a card (left, right, or down), the algorithm adjusts when to show it again based on how you swiped.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if you swipe left, the card will reappear the next day or soon after. Swiping right signals that you know the card, so it’ll show up in a few days. If you swipe right again in a few days, the algorithm will push it back further—maybe even a month. Over time, if you keep swiping right, some cards might not come up again for years.
    </p>

    <p>
      With SuperMemo, you’ll focus on the cards you need to work on while occasionally reviewing the ones you know, helping you lock them into memory.
