# Vocably: Pro Language Flashcards

https://vocably.pro

The problem: I almost always forget the word I translated.

The solution:

1. Select any text I don't know (supports Chrome, Safari, iOS Safari, Android, and YouTube on Desktop).
1. Translate it + Create flashcards of the best possible quality.
1. Revise the flashcards on the mobile app.

Vocably is an integration of ChatGPT Translate, proper language dictionary ([if you are lucky](https://vocably.pro/#:~:text=Vocably%20works%20exceptionally%20well%20for,Traditional%20Chinese%2C%20and%20Simplified%20Chinese.)), and a flashcards app.

## Translate and create flashcards anywhere

For that, Vocably exists in multiple forms:

- Browser extensions for [Desktop Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vocably/baocigmmhhdemijfjnjdidbkfgpgogmb), [Desktop Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/vocably-for-safari/id6464076425), and [iOS Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/vocably-pro-language-cards/id1641258757)
- Mobile application for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/vocably-pro-language-cards/id1641258757) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vocablypro)
- [Web application](https://app.vocably.pro)

## How it works

The video is a bit outdated because Vocably came way further.

Now you can:

1. Select and translate words right from any Android app.
1. The browser extension now works in iOS Safari.
1. iOS select -> translate -> create flashcards from any app in coming soon.
